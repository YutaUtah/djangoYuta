action argument in <form> element enables you to create middle tag i.e. action='/search/' then 2222.2222/search/
method can be either GET or HOST
    GET: go to the link and actually GET the info
    POST: save the info in the backend

so in the <form> you wanna use POST to store the backend data however, it returns "forbidden" error. in that case,
you need to overcome the security status, which is {% csrf_token %}
